# Knowledge Base Builder

# Overview

As a software engineer, I developed a dynamic web-based Knowledge Base Builder to explore modern JavaScript development practices and enhance my understanding of client-side data management. This project demonstrates the implementation of a flexible, user-friendly system for creating and managing customized knowledge bases.

The Knowledge Base Builder allows users to create custom categories with dynamic form components, manage items within these categories, and organize information in both list and card views. The application features a responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, implementing modern UI/UX principles.

The purpose of this project was to create a practical solution for organizing structured information while exploring JavaScript's capabilities in DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage management, and modular programming. It also served as an opportunity to implement proper error handling and state management in a complex web application.
